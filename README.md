# Exhauster-Fan
## Overview of CATIA V5
**CATIA V5** is a powerful CAD software used in product design and 3D modeling. It allows for the creation of complex mechanical systems, like fans, with high precision. CATIA V5 is widely used in industries such as aerospace, automotive, and manufacturing for designing parts, assemblies, and simulations.

I chose CATIA V5 for this project due to its advanced features like:
- **Part Design** for creating individual components.
- **Assembly Design** for bringing components together.
- **Surface Design** for handling complex curves and aerodynamic surfaces.

## Design Process

### Initial Concept
Before moving to CATIA V5, I started with rough sketches of the Exeter fan, considering the fan’s intended use for industrial cooling. I focused on designing a blade shape that would ensure optimal airflow while maintaining energy efficiency.

### Part Design
In the **Part Design** workbench of CATIA V5, I created individual parts for the fan blades, hub, housing, and shaft. Some key tools used were:
- **Pad:** To extrude basic shapes like the fan blade profiles.
- **Pocket:** For creating cut-outs where necessary.
- **Fillet:** For smoothing edges and ensuring aerodynamic efficiency.
- **Revolve:** Used to create cylindrical components, such as the fan hub.

### Assembly
Once the individual components were designed, I used the **Assembly Design** workbench to bring them together. I applied **assembly constraints** such as concentricity and distance to ensure the parts fit together properly.

### Surface Modeling
For more complex curves and the aerodynamic shape of the fan blades, I utilized the **Wireframe and Surface Design** workbench in CATIA. This allowed me to refine the shape of the blades and housing for optimal airflow and performance.

### Rendering and Visualization
To visualize the final design and evaluate its appearance, I used CATIA’s rendering tools. The **Visualization workbench** allowed me to apply materials, textures, and lighting to generate realistic images and animations of the fan.

## Uses of the Exeter Fan
The Exeter fan is designed for industrial cooling systems, HVAC applications, and ventilation. It can be used in:
- **Automotive cooling systems** for engine heat dissipation.
- **Industrial machinery** to prevent overheating.
- **HVAC systems** for large buildings requiring efficient air circulation.

The fan’s design focuses on energy efficiency and optimal airflow, which are critical for reducing operational costs and improving system performance.

## Technical Details

### Materials
The fan is made from **aluminum alloy** for the blades, due to its:
- **Lightweight** properties.
- **Durability** under high-speed operation.
- **Corrosion resistance**, especially in harsh industrial environments.

### Fan Blade Geometry
The fan blades are designed with a **curved geometry** to ensure efficient airflow and minimize energy loss. The blade angle and the number of blades were optimized for the specific airflow requirements of industrial applications.

- **Blade Length:** 150 mm
- **Blade Angle:** 30° for optimal airflow.
- **Number of Blades:** 6 blades for balanced airflow and reduced noise.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenges:
- **Ensuring aerodynamic efficiency** while maintaining structural integrity.
- **Balancing the blades** to prevent vibrations at high RPM.

### Solutions:
- I adjusted the **blade angle** and used **simulation tools** in CATIA V5 to verify the airflow and balance.
- Used **material analysis** in CATIA to ensure the blades were strong enough to handle high rotational speeds.

## Simulation and Testing
Although the design was theoretical, I used **CFD simulations** (Computational Fluid Dynamics) within CATIA to test the airflow efficiency and identify any areas of turbulence or drag. This helped optimize the design for better performance in real-world applications.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **CATIA V5** can be used to design, model, and optimize mechanical systems like fans. The **Exeter fan** design focuses on improving airflow efficiency while maintaining structural strength and reducing noise. Future work will focus on refining the simulation results and optimizing material choices for further efficiency gains.
